Great, it sounds like you have a solid start on your campaign! Here are some ideas for setting the scene to end the chase and introduce the White Rose oasis town:

    If the former captors catch up to the players: You could describe the sound of hooves in the distance, and the players look behind to see a small group of orcish scouts on worgs (large, wolf-like creatures) chasing them. The players can choose to either fight or flee. If they flee successfully, they may come across the oasis town of White Rose.

    If the players successfully evade the former captors: 

    You could describe the players traveling for a while without any sign of pursuit,

    Until they see the shimmering of water in the distance.
    As they approach, they see a small oasis town surrounded by palm trees and sand dunes.
    The town seems peaceful, with a few merchants and travelers going about their business.
    The players can then decide to explore the town and possibly encounter the subplot related to one of their backstories.

As the players enter the town, you can describe the sights and sounds of the market, the smells of exotic spices and fruits, and the general vibe of the place. You can also introduce any important NPCs, such as the town mayor, local merchants, or quest-givers. Make sure to give the players a chance to interact with the NPCs and learn about the town's history and culture.

Remember to be flexible and adapt to the players' actions and interests. If they choose to pursue their own objectives instead of following the main storyline, try to incorporate their choices into the overall narrative. Good luck with your DnD session!
